From Image Recognition to Machine Translation, Deep Learning has enabled us to predict on unstructured data, but these models aren't as accessible to those who lack the right computational resources or large enough datasets. Fortunately, there is a way.

Through the use of pre-trained models available online, models can be fine-tuned to fit your use case without having to invest in large GPUs or gigabytes of data through the use of Keras with a Tensorflow backend. These models can then be made available to your web apps through the use of WebDNN and packaged into a Polymer Web Component for use and re-use across different projects.

This session will cover:
- Where to find existing models online
- How to fine tune your models
- How to port your models to be accessible on the client-side
- Building a simple web component backed by your very own fine-tuned model
- All of which will contain sample code.

At the end of the session, participants should have an idea of how to build their own Web Component built for Deep Learning
