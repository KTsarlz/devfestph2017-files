I'll be giving an intro to Polymer 2.0 syntax and whatâ€™s new in 3.0, then I'll talk about best practices and lessons learned while shipping to 100s of users. This will go over the typical hardships you experience when running Polymer, such as build tools, SSR, dynamic SEO tag generation, using npm, end-to-end testing and so on.
