A collection of bite sized study and work experiences of seeing beauty of theory and math inside code with (appropriate) humor.

The talk includes some of the following relevant scenarios:

1. A poll on CS / IT students and graduates who skip or put math and theory classes last.
2. Why shower thoughts and commute thoughts are healthy before coding?
3. An instance of extremely simple algebra and pre-calculus helped solve a
projectile function in code (No jargons. I promise.).
4. Trigonometry in CSS. WHY AND WHAT FOR?
5. An instance of how nested if elses and long conditions destroyed developer sanity, and how simplifying logic circuits using a K-Map eliminates the problem.
6. An instance on how shifting from an array type data structure to a hash type data structure actually makes run time faster and code look leaner
7. A few other examples hinging on rarely (or non mainstream) used techniques and theory was used in production code such as recursion, and MapReduces / functional mathematics.

**Endnote at:**

Why some people work on theory rather than applications?

**Goal of the talk:**
Appreciation of non hardcore theoretical concepts. Hopefully making some student attendees go to their theory classes more, and professionals to rethink difficult problems with a slight touch of theory.
