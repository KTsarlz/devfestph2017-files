An overview of functional programming in Javascript, its rationale, and
practical uses.

The talk contains the following:

1. Reasons to use FP in javascript when manipulating Arrays and Javascript
Objects.
2. An overview of higher order functions.
3. Code comparison against loops with respect to cleanliness, readability
and testability. The following will be discussed throughout:
    1. Practical applications and techniques for Array.prototype.map
    2. Practical applications and techniques for Array.prototype.filter
    3. Practical applications and techniques for Array.prototype.reduce
4. Distinguishing which higher order function to use in which situations, with comparisons to real world objects and processes which do not contain code.
5. Technical interview and hiring results summary. (e.g., some JS Devs with more than 5 years of experience still use loops with array transformations, and its implications)
6. A quick briefing of some FP libraries in Javascript.
7. Comparison with other FP languages such as Elixir

**Goal of the talk:**
For the audience to maintain a better standing at javascript interviews, especially students and younger professionals. To make working with data in JS easier.
